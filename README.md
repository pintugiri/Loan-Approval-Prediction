The project file appears to be focused on "Loan Approval Prediction" with a model achieving 96% accuracy. It includes tasks such as risk assessment and loan approval modeling using a synthetic dataset of 20,000 records. The key milestones likely revolve around the following steps:

* Situation: A synthetic dataset comprising personal and financial data of 20,000 individuals was provided to predict loan approval outcomes. The goal was to build a model that could predict loan approval with high accuracy.

* Task: Your task was to analyze the dataset, preprocess it for modeling, select features, and train a predictive model to classify loan approvals. You were also responsible for optimizing the model for better accuracy.

* Result: Achieved a high accuracy of 96% in predicting loan approvals, using an optimized classification model. This result significantly improved the decision-making process for loan approval in the synthetic environment.


#Languages:

Python is the primary programming language used in the code. It is widely used in data science and machine learning due to its vast ecosystem of libraries,

such as:

Pandas, Numpy for data manipulation.
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization.
Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost for machine learning.
